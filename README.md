## About The Data Wrangling Workshop
While a huge amount of data is readily available to us, it is not useful in its raw form. For data to be meaningful, it must be curated and refined. 

If you’re a beginner, then The Data Wrangling Workshop will help to break down the process for you. You’ll start with the basics and build your knowledge, progressing from the core aspects behind data wrangling, to using the most popular tools and techniques.  

## What you will learn
* Explore data wrangling with the help of real-world examples and business use cases 
* Study various ways to extract the most value from your data in minimal time 
* Boost your knowledge with bonus topics, such as random data generation and data integrity checks
