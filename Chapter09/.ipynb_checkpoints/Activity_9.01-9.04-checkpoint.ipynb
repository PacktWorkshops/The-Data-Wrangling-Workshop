    "# Illustration of a practical data wrangling task\n",
    "\n",
    "In this Notebook, we will show a practical data wrangling task step-by-step - how it is structured, what you should watch for, and how to improvise.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The task\n",
    "Imagine the question: ***\"In India, did the enrollment in primary/secondary/tertiary education increase with improvement of per capita GDP in the past 15 years?\"***\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the actual modeling and analysis will be done by some senior data scientist, who will use some machine learning and visualization for the job. As a data wrangling expert, **your job is to acquire and provide her with a clean dataset which contains educational enrollment and GDP data side by side.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### The data source\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a link for a **[dataset from the United Nations](http://data.un.org)** and you can download the dataset of education (for all the nations around the world). But this dataset has some missing values and moreover it does not have any GDP information. Someone has given you another separate CSV file (downloaded from the World Bank site) which contains GDP data but in a messy format.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will examine how to handle these two separate sources and to clean the data to prepare a simple final dataset with the required data and save it to the local drive as a SQL database file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The link for the education data: http://data.un.org/_Docs/SYB/CSV/SYB61_T07_Education.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "The link for the GDP data (hosted on Packt Github repository for this course): https://github.com/TrainingByPackt/Data-Wrangling-with-Python/blob/master/Lesson09/Activity25/India_World_Bank_Info.csv"
